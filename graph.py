    Graph and its representations

    Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:
    1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
    2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.
    The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of a
    directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that
    there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v.
    The edges may contain weight/value/cost.
    
    Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.
    1. Adjacency Matrix
    2. Adjacency List
